            <p>Hello, my name is Hannes and I am interested in programming. I have experience with JavaScript, Java and recently C++. I have also experimented with the Spring Boot framework, where I created a simple email sender.</p>
            <p>My interest in technology began with video games, but it has since developed into a broader interest in the potential of technology and its applications. I try to live according to my beliefs in tech, economy and environment. In my spare time, I am passionate about video games and making music.</p>
