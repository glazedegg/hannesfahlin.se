            <p>Hello, my name is Hannes Fahlin. </p> 
            <p>I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Informatics in Computer Science from the University of Skövde, expecting to graduate in June 2025. I have taken courses in Database Systems, Discrete Mathematics, and Web Development - Programming of Mobile Applications.</p>
            <p>I recently interned at Söderberg & Partners in Stockholm as a Software Engineering intern. During my tenure, I developed backend products and RESTful APIs using Swagger, C#, and ASP.NET Core. I also collaborated on a project to enhance a Microsoft Teams bot, which resulted in a 20% increase in customer satisfaction.</p>
            <p>Some of my notable projects include an Email Sender Application developed using Java and Spring Boot and a Roulette Game coded in C++. </p> 
            <p>I am proficient in Java, C#, JavaScript, Git, HTML, and CSS. I am a native Swedish speaker and bilingual in English.</p>
